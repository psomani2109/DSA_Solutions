### 📜 Problem Description

Given an array  **arr[]** of non-negative integers, where each element  **arr[i]**  represents the height of the **** vertical lines, find the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, together with the x-axis.

**Note:**  In the case of a single vertical line it will not be able to hold water.

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: 5 and 3 are 2 distance apart. So the size of the base is 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 3 * 2 = 6.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
Output: 12
Explanation: 5 and 3 are 4 distance apart. So the size of the base is 4. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. So, total area to hold water = 4 * 3 = 12.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 8, 6, 4, 6, 5, 5]
Output: 25 
Explanation: 8 and 5 are 5 distance apart. So the size of the base is 5. Height of container = min(8, 5) = 5. So, the total area to hold water = 5 * 5 = 25.
```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
