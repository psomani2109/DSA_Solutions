### 📜 Problem Description

Consider an array arr[] **** of size n, initially containing all zeros. You are also given an array  **updates[]**  of k positive integers.

For each value j in updates[], add 1 to every element arr[i] whose index satisfies i ≥ j.

The indices in updates[] are 1-based.

Perform all the updates and modify arr[] accordingly.

**Examples:**

```
Input: n = 3, updates[] = [1, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3, 4]
Explanation: Initially, arr[] = [0, 0, 0]. After the first update 1, the array becomes [1, 1, 1]. 
After the second update 1, it becomes [2, 2, 2]. The update 2 increments all elements from index 2 onward, giving [2, 3, 3]. Finally, the update 3 increments the element at index 3, resulting in [2, 3, 4].
```

```
Input: n = 2, updates[] = [1, 1, 1]
Output: [3, 3] 
Explanation: Initially the array is [0, 0]. After the first 1, it becomes [1, 1]. 
After the second 1 it becomes [2, 2]. After the third 1, it becomes [3, 3].
