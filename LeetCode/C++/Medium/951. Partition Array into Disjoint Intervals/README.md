### 📜 Problem Description

Given an integer array  `nums` , partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays  `left`  and  `right`  so that:

	
- Every element in  `left`  is less than or equal to every element in  `right` .
	
- `left`  and  `right`  are non-empty.
	
- `left`  has the smallest possible size.

Return  *the length of*  `left`  *after such a partitioning* .

Test cases are generated such that partitioning exists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
	
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 106`
	
- There is at least one valid answer for the given input.
